/**
 * Snapshot cleanup policy: the config-backed policy, its validation, the
 * Ported from SiriLee/dsh-rewind (MIT), src/snapshot-cleanup.ts.
 *
 *
 * `/snapshot-auto-cleanup` command's argument grammar, and the auto-sweep
 * throttle. Kept free of host wiring so the policy and the parser are
 * unit-testable in isolation; `src/index.ts` is the only consumer.
 *
 * Semantics (the "cleanup" vocabulary deliberately avoids "retention"):
 * - `enabled` toggles the AUTOMATIC (24h) sweep. `false` (the default) keeps
 *   every snapshot — the pre-feature behavior — and never persists a policy.
 * - `maxAgeDays` is the only "keep" knob: a finished session dir whose newest
 *   member stamp is older than this many days of idle is removed by a sweep.
 *   `0`/negative/non-integer are rejected, so a broken value can never steer
 *   the sweep into deleting everything.
 * - The policy is this plugin entry's live configuration (`autoCleanupEnabled` /
 *   `autoCleanupMaxAgeDays` — named for what they gate, because the entry's own
 *   `disabled:` flag sits beside them in the same document); an absent value is
 *   the safe default (off), and an invalid one fail-closes a sweep (deletes
 *   nothing) instead of guessing.
