/**
 * Pure rewind planning: target resolution and surface-range computation.
 * No I/O and no `Session` dependency — everything derives from the event log
 * and the ordered surface, so this module stays unit-testable.
 *
 * Rewind semantics: rewinding to a user message appends a marker node into the
 * session log whose `surfaceOp` replaces every surface node FROM the target
 * with itself. The log (audit trail, rendered transcript) is untouched; only
 * the model-visible surface is cut, so the next request derives its context
 * from before the target message onward. The marker is a `user/message`
 * carrying a replace `surfaceOp` and the producer-owned source
 * `{ kind: 'dsh-session-manager-rewind' }` (see `marker.ts`).
 *
 * Ported from SiriLee/dsh-rewind (MIT), src/rewind.ts.
